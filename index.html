<!-- I am currently coding this right before the deadline for the April cohort, this is a rough of what I would actually like to do and I will be improving the website in the future. I appreciate any and all feedback to improve my website and make it look less tacky, I made this in a rush so I wasn't able to make it look exactly how I wanted it to. Tips and tricks appreciated in the feedback! -->

        <h3>Who am I</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Alex, and I am studying to become a software developer. I moved to the USA on late 2019 by myself to go to college, however due to world events I had some issues achieving that goal. After taking a couple of years to get back on my feet I decided to sign up for a bootcamp as I concluded it would be the better option overall. Currently I am living in Maine.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
         Growing up I've always had an interest in creating things. Be it through art, writing, or coding, the idea of making something for others to perceive brings me joy. As a young teenager I discovered how to tamper with the files of games I enjoyed playing, however I didn't understand how moving some files around would cause such big changes in the games I would play. Seeing this would awaken the passion for coding that I have now. Web development is one of the many skills I will be learning to further my knowledge in Software Development. Since I moved to the USA I've worked a couple of jobs, the one I worked for the longest is a restaurant where I had to work with a team of waiters and cooks which I get along with really well. I am more than comfortable working in a team environment and am open to criticism, feedback, and co-operating with fellow co-workers.

          My other main interest is art, I've drawn for as long as I have memory. I find joy in being able to recreate and leak my thoughts onto a sheet of paper so that I can share them with others.
